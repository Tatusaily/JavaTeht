/*
A coffee maker has a selector for coffee type (normal/espresso) and a selector for coffee amount (10â€“80 ml).
It also has an of/off switch that behaves in the same way as TV of/off switch.
Coffee type and amount selectors behave like TV channel switch, i.e., they can only be changed when the device is on,
and the device remembers the selections even when it is switched off.
